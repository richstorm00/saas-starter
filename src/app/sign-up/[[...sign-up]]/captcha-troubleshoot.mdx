# CAPTCHA Troubleshooting Guide

## Common CAPTCHA Issues and Solutions

### Issue: "CAPTCHA failed to load"

This error typically occurs due to browser or network-related issues. Here are the most effective solutions:

## âœ… Immediate Solutions (Try in order)

### 1. **Use OAuth Sign-up** (Recommended)
- Click "Sign up with Google" or "Sign up with GitHub" below
- These methods bypass CAPTCHA entirely
- Fastest and most reliable solution

### 2. **Browser Troubleshooting**
- **Disable ad blockers** (uBlock Origin, AdBlock, etc.)
- **Disable security extensions** (NoScript, Privacy Badger)
- **Use incognito/private mode**
- **Try a different browser** (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)

### 3. **Network Solutions**
- **Check firewall settings**
- **Disable VPN temporarily**
- **Try mobile data instead of WiFi**
- **Clear browser cache/cookies**

### 4. **Technical Fixes**
- **Update your browser** to the latest version
- **Disable browser extensions** (especially security-focused ones)
- **Allow JavaScript** from `clerk.com` domains
- **Check browser console** for specific error messages

## ðŸ”§ Advanced Solutions

### For Developers
- Ensure `clerk.com` domains are whitelisted in CSP headers
- Check for conflicts with service workers
- Verify DNS resolution for `clerk.com` domains

### For Network Admins
- Whitelist domains: `clerk.com`, `clerk.dev`, `*.clerk.com`
- Allow connections to: `https://api.clerk.com`, `https://*.clerk.com`

## ðŸ“ž Contact Support

If none of these solutions work:
- **Email**: support@quantumai.com
- **Include**: Browser type, error message, and steps you've tried
- **Response time**: Usually within 2-4 hours during business hours

## ðŸŽ¯ Why This Happens

CAPTCHA failures are usually caused by:
- **Browser security settings** being too restrictive
- **Network restrictions** (corporate firewalls, school networks)
- **Extension conflicts** blocking required scripts
- **Outdated browsers** not supporting modern security features

The OAuth sign-up options (Google/GitHub) are the most reliable workaround since they don't require CAPTCHA verification.
